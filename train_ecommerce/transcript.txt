ticket = Ticket(origin="New York City", destination="Chicago", date_of_travel=date(2021, 10, 1), class_of_travel="Business Class", price=50.00, availability_status="Available")

payment_method = PaymentMethod(name="Credit Card")
transaction = Transaction(ticket=ticket, payment_details=payment_method, transaction_status="Completed")
with open('user.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(user.__dict__, f)
with open('ticket.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(ticket.__dict__, f)
with open('train.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(train.__dict__, f)
with open('seat.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(seat.__dict__, f)
with open('payment_method.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(payment_method.__dict__, f)
with open('transaction.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(transaction.__dict__, f)
