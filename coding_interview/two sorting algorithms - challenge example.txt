Prompt:
You're competent software developer and implement two sorting algorithms such as bubble sort and insertion sort in Python

Response:
  Sure, here is an example of how to implement the bubble sort and insertion sort algorithms in Python:

Bubble Sort:
```
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```
Insertion Sort:
```
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i-1
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j+1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j+1] = key
    return arr
```
These algorithms are simple to understand and implement, but they have a time complexity of O(n^2) for bubble sort and O(n^2) for insertion sort. For larger datasets, more efficient sorting algorithms such as quicksort or mergesort may be preferred.
